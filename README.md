```python
from pypayment import QiwiPayment, QiwiPaymentType
from datetime import timedelta

QiwiPayment.authorize("my_secret_key",
                      theme_code="my_theme_code",
                      expiration_duration=timedelta(hours=1),
                      payment_type=QiwiPaymentType.CARD)
```

#### Creating invoice

To created new QIWI invoice, you need to instantiate `QiwiPayment` with 1 required parameter.

```python
from pypayment import Payment, QiwiPayment

payment: Payment = QiwiPayment(amount=123.45)

print(payment.url)  # https://oplata.qiwi.com/form/?invoice_uid=payment_unique_id
```

And 4 optional parameters that will override default ones for specific instance.

- `description` - Payment comment that will be displayed to user.
- `theme_code` - Code for displaying custom name and colors of the form. (Get it [here](https://qiwi.com/p2p-admin/transfers/link))

```python

from datetime import timedelta

different_payment: Payment = QiwiPayment(amount=987.65,
                                         description="Flower pot",
                                         theme_code="my_new_theme_code",
                                         expiration_duration=timedelta(days=3),
                                         payment_type=QiwiPaymentType.CARD)
