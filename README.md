                      theme_code="my_theme_code",
                      expiration_duration=timedelta(hours=1),
                      payment_type=QiwiPaymentType.CARD)
```

#### Creating invoice

To created new QIWI invoice, you need to instantiate `QiwiPayment` with 1 required parameter.

```

And 4 optional parameters that will override default ones for specific instance.
